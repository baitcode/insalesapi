Hi all!

This module contains classes for organizing rest like integration with isSales SaaS eCommerce platform.

Basically you should use Dao classes form insaleapi package, instantiating them using your api_key,
api_password(you'llget those in your insales backoffice) and host of shop, example www.skychip.ru or
skychip.myinsales.ru.

Methods are simple they all return lists of typed objects from insalesapi.object package. If you're IDE
understands EpiDoc you'll be twice happier, coz almost all function have marked return types.
Everything is quite simple and intuitive, if not, feel free to submit ticket.

More on insales www.insales.ru.

Good luck, and feel free to ask any question by email: batiyiv at gmail dot com.
